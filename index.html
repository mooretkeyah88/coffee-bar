        <!-- There are a couple things off about this: 1. CSS information should be in a style tag in the head, not the body (In this case, we'd want to put it in style.css as we are linking the file to HTML). 2. CSS syntax says that anything following a period must be the name of the class (I.E .divclass{} css code) and must define a class in HTML (I.E <div class="divclass"> code </div>). 3. I'd use a different name from div1. You want your css to make sense to you and your professor. -->
